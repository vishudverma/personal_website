Welcome to the source code of my personal Website!
# I'm still learning a lot of stuff please dont bash on me, you can bash on me if you have some imporvement suggestions (would really appreciate that)
# Why?
I have always wanted to have a personal portfolio page and even tho some of the components within my web-site and its pages are missing I hosted it to check out the hosting procedures.
# What are you doing here?
Well if you are reading this you can copy my website, and make a few tweaks to it, and personalize it in your own image which ill be more than happy to help with.
### Right now i have issue in the contact and projects sections there are none uploaded so, i'll fix that, or maybe you can help me with it.
otherwise the website is live;
go check it out <a href="https://vishudverma.github.io/personal_website/">here</a>.
